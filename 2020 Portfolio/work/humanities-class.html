            Humanities Class is a summer program for high school students interested in gaining valuable experience in humanities research before college. The organization was founded by John Yoon, a graduate of Cornell University, as a way to aid students from all backgrounds who want to pursue an education in the humanities fields. The main purpose of this website is to be the main source of information and guidance for application for parents and high school students interested in participating in the program. At the onset of development, I knew I had to strive for unintrusive design and clear typography to ensure the efficiency of communication. This led to an extremely basic layout with minimal distractions and visual flare. Surprisingly, the challenge of designing this website came from working to achieve an ideal balance between professionalism and showiness.
