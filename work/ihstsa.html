            IHSTSA is a club at Ithaca High School focused on inspiring and motivating student engineers through the completion of diverse and challenging projects. As a member, this chapter website was developed as a part of the Webmaster event for the 2020 National TSA Conference. During the design of this website, I focused on portraying the academic and student-focused characteristics of the club through the use of a carefully structured grid layout and images that captured the friendly atmosphere. I also prioritized simplicity in design and navigation, for the target audience of this website was extremely diverse. Whether it be a parent interested in finding a STEM-related activity for their child, a teenager researching for local STEM opportunities, or a grandparent eager to donate and support their grandchildren's education, I wanted to ensure that the information was easily accessible and that anyone could find exactly what they were looking for.
