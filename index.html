                <p>IHSTSA is a club at Ithaca High School focused on inspiring and motivating student engineers through the completion of diverse and challenging projects. As a member, this chapter website was developed as a part of the Webmaster event for the 2020 National TSA Conference. During the design of this website, I focused on portraying the academic and student-focused characteristics of the club through the use of a carefully structured grid layout and images that captured the friendly atmosphere. I also prioritized simplicity in design and navigation, for the target audience of this website was extremely diverse. Whether it be a parent interested in finding a STEM-related activity for their child, a teenager researching for local STEM opportunities, or a grandparent eager to donate and support their grandchildren's education, I wanted to ensure that the information was easily accessible and that anyone could find exactly what they were looking for.</p>

                <p>Humanities Class is a summer program for high school students interested in gaining valuable experience in humanities research before college. The organization was founded by John Yoon, a graduate of Cornell University, as a way to aid students from all backgrounds who want to pursue an education in the humanities fields. The main purpose of this website is to be the main source of information and guidance for application for parents and high school students interested in participating in the program. At the onset of development, I knew I had to strive for unintrusive design and clear typography to ensure the efficiency of communication. This led to an extremely basic layout with minimal distractions and visual flare. Surprisingly, the challenge of designing this website came from working to achieve an ideal balance between professionalism and showiness.</p>

                <p>Von Cramm Cooperative is a cooperative house at Cornell University with a diverse group of 34 undergraduate, graduate, and international exchange students. Their goal is to be a welcoming and safe community that supports and enriches its members through thoughtful interaction, responsibility, and generosity. The process of design was surprisingly fun due to the variety in layout and my lack of previous experience in this style of website. With almost seven decades of rich history, I wanted to portray a homey, aged, and somewhat rustic feel. I achieved this with the use of an old-style serif font and a musty color palette, which had a combinatory effect that showed age, comfort, and familiarity.</p>

                <p>John is a recent graduate of Cornell University who reached out for a professional portfolio and resume website. Looking for a job as a journalist, he wanted a website that he could send to employers and colleagues, meaning it had to include his previous work and experience in a formal presentation. Simplicity, ease of use, and professionalism were imperative, and this led to the development and design of an extremely minimal layout and look.</p>
