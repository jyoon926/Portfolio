        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="col">
            <p>
                I am a senior in high school and a first-generation Korean American.<br><br>
                Since my childhood, I have been intrigued by and exposed to countless subjects and hobbies mostly in the STEM and design fields. For as long as I can remember, I have had a fanatical passion for learning everything that I found to be intriguing, and to satisfy my urges of curiosity, I would spend hours on end probing through the interweb to scavenge every bit of information I could. From graphic design, illustration, game development, animation, and 3D modeling to machining, computer-aided design, woodworking, and architecture, I would always find something new to try to master.<br><br>
                Web design is one of my biggest passions due to the constant loop of problem solving and creativity. Over the past six years, I have developed more than fifteen websites for clients, competitions, and personal activities. Each one has taught me something new, different, and exciting, and it brings me great excitement every time I embark on a new project.
